## 🚀 Quick Overview

👉 This project enables **Home Assistant** to monitor data of a **UGOS based UGreen NAS** - *without modifying its operating system in any way*. No extra tools/scripts are installed in UGOS, no ssh access with cryptic shell commands is needed; we simply use what UGOS already provides.

</p>

The integration has two parts: A Token Server running as a Docker container. It retrieves and renews access authorization tokens. And a Home-Assistant custom integration. It uses the tokens to read data from the NAS by utilizing an UGOS-builtin API, and updates your HA sensors.
